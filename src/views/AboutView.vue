            As more people get into competitive programming and the USACO, more resources are
            available to help you prepare for the competition. However, there was one piece missing-
            practice. It's essential to learn the concepts and techniques, but it's equally, if not
            more important, to practice them. Until I created Algo, there were two options: randomly
            clicking on previous contests' problems or using train.usaco.org. <br /><br />
            <span class="font-bold"
              >However, clicking on problems randomly is inefficient, and train.usaco.org is
              incredibly outdated
            </span>
            (most of the website hasn't had a refresh or update since the early 2010s). So, I
            created Algo to help people practice USACO problems and help them get ready for the
            USACO. <br /><br />
            Algo is a web application designed to supercharge your USACO training. It randomly
            generates problems from past contests so that you can practice them. Algo will process
            and show the problems in a simple, clean interface. After solving the problem, you can
            submit your solution to the USACO website to check if your program works.
