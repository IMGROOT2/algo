<h2>About Algo</h2>
<p>As more people get into competitive programming and the USACO, more resources are available to help you prepare for the competition. However, there was one piece missing- practice. It's essential to learn the concepts and techniques, but it's equally, if not more important, to practice them. Until I created Algo, there were two options: randomly clicking on previous contests' problems or using train.usaco.org.

However, clicking on problems randomly is inefficient, and train.usaco.org is incredibly outdated (most of the website hasn't had a refresh or update since the early 2010s). So, I created Algo to help people practice USACO problems and help them get ready for the USACO.

Algo is a web application designed to supercharge your USACO training. It randomly generates problems from past contests so that you can practice them. Algo will process and show the problems in a simple, clean interface. After solving the problem, you can submit your solution to the USACO website to check if your program works.</p>
